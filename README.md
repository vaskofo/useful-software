# Windows

## SignalRGB (Not open-source)
### Probably the best RGB software that there is. Works with almost every products from every major brand and also lets you sync everything, without the need for different branded bloatware.

## Rainmeter (Not open-source) & Droptop 4
### Rainmeter is mostly used to costumise your Windows experience however you want with very diverse addons available. Droptop 4 is the star of the show here. It's a simple top bar, as you'd see on Mac or Linux, but for Windows! It's costumisable through a GUI, or through a config file if you're comfortable with that.

## TaskbarX
### A simple app that simply centers the icons on the taskbar. Simple.
